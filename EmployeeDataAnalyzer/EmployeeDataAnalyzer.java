        employees and EmployeeProcessor to process them concurrently.

/*
    -> Explanation:
        * This class is an entry point that drives the full application.
        * Creates an instance of EmployeeManager.
        * Adds four sample employees.
        * Creates and starts three threads (EmployeeProcessor) to simulate concurrent access.
        * Uses join() to ensure the main thread waits for all processors to finish.
        * Filters and prints employees with salary â‰¥ 70000.
        * Sorts and prints all employees by salary.
